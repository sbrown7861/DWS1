<h2>Acoustic Guitars</h2>

<p>I currently have two acoustic guitars. One is a Kona K2 this one is an acoustic electric guitar and was given to me
by my parents for Christmas when I was 16, this was my first guitar and will always hold a special place for me. <a href= FIG1.>FIG1.</a> </p>

<p>My second acoustic is a Epiphone Dreadnought. I got this guitar when I was 18 and it is an acoustic only guitar. 
This guitar is a cheaper version of the Gibson Dreadnought, it is made by a the same company. Although this is the cheaper model
is still has a very nice tone to it and is very easy to play. I would recommend that anyone wanting to learn how to play guitar 
to get one of these to start. It is a great value and is a good guitar overall. <a href= FIG2.>FIG2.</a> </p>
