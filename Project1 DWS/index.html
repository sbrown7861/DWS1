<p>This site is going to be information on my current guitar collection, types, models, and a little bit about them.</p>
<h2 id="Acoustic Guitars">Acoustic Guitars</h2>

<p>I currently have two acoustic guitars. One is a Kona K2 this one is an acoustic electric guitar and was given to me
by my parents for Christmas when I was 16, this was my first guitar and will always hold a special place for me. <a href="#FIG1.">(FIG1.)</a> </p>

<p>My second acoustic is a Epiphone Dreadnought. I got this guitar when I was 18 and it is an acoustic only guitar. 
This guitar is a cheaper version of the Gibson Dreadnought, it is made by a the same company. Although this is the cheaper model
is still has a very nice tone to it and is very easy to play. I would recommend that anyone wanting to learn how to play guitar 
to get one of these to start. It is a great value and is a good guitar overall. <a href="#FIG2.">(FIG2.)</a> </p>

<p>So I would like to start off with the fact that I <em>LOVE</em> guitars, for electric guitars I currently have five 
and over the years I think all together I have had 15 or so. That being said I will just go into detail about a few of my 
personal favorites. </p>

<p>My all time favorite has to be my Schecter Damien Solo 6 Elite. The story behind this one is all my friends got together and pitched in money 
to get me it for my 21st birthday. This is the one that I play most often, It is a electric guitar with active pickups this means the pickups 
have some extra power to them and "pick up" minor vibrations from the strings while filtering out any unwanted feed-back giving the guitar a clean
punch to it. <a href="#FIG3.">(FIG3).</a></p>

<p>My second favorite is my Ibanez Prestige. This one is currently a project of mine that I have been updating, this was my first electric guitar and 
had some dings and cracks in the paint. So I completely disassembled it and sanded it to bare wood to refinish it. I also took out all the electronics 
and am currently switching the pickups to be active pickups like my Schecter. I love the response and tone that active pickups deliver. Here is a before
 <a href="#FIG4.">(FIG4.)</a> and an after. <a href="#FIG5.">(FIG5.)</a></p>
 
 <p>My newest guitar is another Ibanez and is a 350DX. Ibanez is known for guitars used to play rock or metal this guitar is a little different from
 my other ones because it has a floating tremolo (bridge) this allows the user to change the pitch to low or high depending on how they use the action.
 This type of bridge is used a lot in guitar solos to create screaming highs and dive bombs. <a href= "#FIG6.">(FIG6.)</a> </p>
